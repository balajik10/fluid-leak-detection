# fluid leak detection
 This project is an AI-driven fluid leak detection system designed to monitor industrial pipelines in real-time. Using a Seeed Wio Terminal, DFRobot water flow sensor, and a neural network model, the system analyzes flow rate data to identify leaks instantly. Built with Edge Impulse for model training and Arduino IDE for deployment, it detects abnormal flow patterns with 100% accuracy, providing timely alerts to prevent environmental and operational damage. This compact, scalable solution integrates advanced machine learning and sensor technology for proactive leak management in industrial settings.
